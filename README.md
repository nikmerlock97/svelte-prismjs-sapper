# Prismjs Sapper Example

This is an example repo for [svelte-prismjs](https://github.com/phptuts/svelte-prism).

You will want to look at the rollup config for css only plugin, and template.html file if you are not using a cdn.

In the routes/index.svelte is where I use plugin. Notice that I am importing it onMount.
